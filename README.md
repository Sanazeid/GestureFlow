# GestureFlow
Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition application using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect gestures like “like,” “dislike,” and “peace.” Implemented landmark detection and gesture classification with dynamic overlays, applying image processing techniques and integrating computer vision and machine learning for an interactive user experience.
